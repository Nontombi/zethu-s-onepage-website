      <h4 class="text-center">#education</h4>
      <p class="text-center">Many students dont have internet access at home or realiable cellphone services as a result its very difficult to give the students homeworks. as many as them dont have the ability to look up resources at home,post their work,or get into contact to get help.communication is so important in schools because you gain more knowledge,more skills. </p>

      <h3 class="text-center">LACK OF RESOURCES!</h3>
      <h4 class="text-center">#education</h4>
      <p class="text-center">In rural areas most of schools have no computer labs because of some areas there still no electricity on others there is but they cant have labs because most of rural areas school there is no security.and there is still lack of text books for example four learners are using one text book,when exams coming they suffering because they must exchange it  so they endup have no enough time to study and i think are the main resoason causes high rate of failures.</p>

      <h3 class="text-center">POVERTY!</h3> 
      <h4 class="text-center">#education</h4>
      <p class="text-center">This is a probarly the biggest obstacle someof students lives in home with limited food going to school without having any meal that causes lack of focus in their studies because while the teacher standing infront doing the lesson he or she thinking about the situation back at home  or on intermittent access to running water/electricty .this comes with a whole host of challeges not only in school work but also limited ability to participate in extra curricular activities. </p>

      <h3 class="text-center">SOLUTIONS!</h3>

      <p>Technology can be a great way to improve access to resources and content they can also significantly improve the communication between teachers ,students and parents,particulary in rural areas.Trained teachers in their subjects  unless the teachers are awere of the subjects they are teaching,what can be expected of the students.therefore training the teachers should be first step to ensure the most  fundamental requirement can be met.Rural connectivity schools are present in the rural areas they lack connectivity which force alot of students to opt out since travelling over long distance to school.Incentivise schooling the mid-day meal is a great incetive for students from poverishd background to go to school,the government should develop more feeding schemes to appeal to students so that they have no resoason not to go to school everyday</p> </div>
